The 21st-century hipster is a subculture (sometimes called hipsterism).[1][2] Fashion is one of the major markers of hipster identity.[3] Members of the subculture typically do not self-identify as hipsters,[1] and the word hipster is often used as a pejorative for someone who is pretentious or overly concerned with appearing trendy.[4]
